 * TWO PILLAR SERVICES.
 *
 * The site previously ran eight standalone service pages (estate, commercial,
 * foreclosure, hoarding, junk removal, move-out, light demolition). Those are
 * consolidated here into two pillars — cleanouts and demolition — and the 301s
 * in next.config.mjs point each old URL at the matching pillar page. The
 * cleanout types are named in the cleanouts definition and audience list
 * rather than broken out into their own sections.
 *
 * Do not re-split these into separate pages without also updating
 * next.config.mjs redirects, navigation.ts, and the sitemap.
